# BioSpring

BioSpring is a molecular simulation software based on a spring network, especially designed for
interactive simulations. The main goal of BioSpring is to allow user to interactively explore the biomechanical properties biomolecule using spring network model at different scales (all atom, coarsed grain, Carbon-Alpha, ...).

## Description

### Input

Biospring is a simulation program which takes two files as input. The first one describes the structure and the biophysical properties of the system you want to study using the NetCDF binary format to describe this data (`.nc`), and the second one a text file which describes the parameters and settings for the spring network simulation (`.msp`).

See the [User manual](doc/User_Manual.md) in the doc directory for more information.

See the [MSP Options](doc/MSP_Options.md) file for the full list of parameters.


### Features

Here is a list of the most important features added in this branch:

- Add Martini3 data for IMPALA coarse grained simulations
- Accept Martini3 structure input with bonds
- Update FreeSASA configuration in command line
- Add interactors & manage indepedent threads for MDDriver and FreeSASA
- Add CustomData class to InteractorMDDriver
- Extend IMPALA equations to switch between single flat to curved double membrane
- Add Rigidbody dynamics
- Add roll angle computation to InsertionVector
- Update and reformat other scripts in the project ...


## Compilation & Installation

### Requirements

- CMake (http://www.cmake.org)
- NetCDF library (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/)
- NetCDF library headers for the C++ library (https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-cxx4)

### Optional tools

- FreeSASA library (https://github.com/mittinatten/freesasa/) version 2.1.2
- MDDriver library (https://github.com/LBT-CNRS/MDDriver) version 1.0


- UnityMol (http://unitymol.sourceforge.net/) or VMD visualization software (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)

### Compilation

### Dependencies

Cmake & NetCDF library installation is straightforward on Linux:

    apt install cmake libnetcdf-c++4-dev

On macOS, it's quite convenient to use a dedicated conda environment:

    conda env create -f conda-env.yml -n biospring
    conda activate biospring

### BioSpring

```
git clone https://github.com/LBT-CNRS/biospring
cd biospring/

# On Windows with Microsoft Visual Studio 16 for example
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/path/to/biospring/installation -G "Visual Studio 16 2019"

# On Mac/Linux
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/path/to/biospring/installation

# Compilation
cmake --build build -j4
cmake --install
```

### BioSpring with MDDriver and FreeSASA

BioSpring can also be compiled with MDDriver and/or FreeSASA support with those cmake options:

    cmake -S . -B build -DMDDRIVER_SUPPORT=ON -DMDDriver_DIR=/path/to/mddriver/installation/MDDriver/cmake/ -DFREESASA_SUPPORT=ON -DFREESASA_PREFIX=/path/to/freesasa/installation/freesasa-2.1.2/


### Test

BioSpring integrates unit & regressions tests. You can test the software with those commands:

    cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
    cmake --build build -j4
    ctest --test-dir build


### Usage

A detailed explanation is available in the [User Manual](doc/User_Manual.md).

#### Examples

A simple 2 particles system is available in `example/2particles`.
